#### A place to share recreation of Open Brush output via individual http API commands

more on the [Open Brush http API](https://docs.openbrush.app/user-guide/open-brush-api/api-commands)

For now it's just a PowerShell script.

You will need at least to download:

1) [http_api.ps1](http_api.ps1) PowerShell script

2) [london_maps.txt](london_maps.txt) file representing the individual Open Brush http API commands, assuming Open Brush is running on localhost

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillington/open-brush/main/docs/http_api_scripts/london_maps.txt

This is how I run the script in PowerShell.

Have a look at [london_maps.txt](london_maps.txt) to see what's going on under the hood...
